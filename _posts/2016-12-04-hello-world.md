I'll be using this blog to write about PowerShell and related technologies, primarily.

I wanted to try out [Jekyll] on [GitHub Pages][GP] for blog hosting, because I write a lot of [Markdown][MD]/[GFM] these days. I'm also excited about the idea of not needing to pay for a website host, maintain database backups, or continuously patch WordPress.

My experience with setting up the blog, selecting a theme, and customizing it as desired will be covered in the next post.[^1]

See the footer for a link to this blog's open source repository. The [readme] contains a lot of the links I used to get started.
