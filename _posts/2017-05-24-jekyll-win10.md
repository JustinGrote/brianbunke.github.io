This blog lives on [GitHub Pages], and my personal computer is running Windows 10. This is a lot like owning a cat and a dog. With enough time and effort, they'll begrudgingly tolerate each other, and not much else.

> I previously covered setting up my blog: [Personalizing GitHub Pages].

Back in the dark ages--so, like, _three months ago_--I used to commit and push every single tweak to see how Jekyll/GHP/my theme behaved. You can look through this blog's commit history for multiple fun sessions of 5-6 straight commits trying to wrestle with CSS.

That process is lame, so you have two options, AFAIK:

- Follow the official [Jekyll on Windows walkthrough]
- Be like me, and follow [@FooBartn]'s ["Install Jekyll on Win10 (The Awesome Way)"]
  - Jekyll on Ruby on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

I'm posting this because I want a public record of the process I used, and so I have a quick reference of how to run Jekyll again when I forget next time :)

### One-Time Install

Again, this install is just a copy from [@FooBartn's post]. It worked for me in March 2017.

_NOTE: Apologies in advance for the terrible syntax highlighting here. I [raised an issue] in my blog to investigate (please LMK if you have advice!), but obviously haven't solved it yet._

```posh
# Enable Windows Dev Mode
$DevModeKey = 'HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock\'
Set-ItemProperty -Path $DevModeKey -Name 'AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense' -Value 1 -Type DWord
Set-ItemProperty -Path $DevModeKey -Name 'AllowAllTrustedApps' -Value 1 -Type DWord

# Open the App Wizard
& appwiz.cpl
```
- Select Turn Windows features on or off (Left Sidebar)
- Scroll down and check the box labeled “Windows Subsystem for Linux Beta”
- Allow your computer to restart

Upon restart:

- Launch `bash.exe`
- Say `y` to continue, then follow the instructions

Ok, from the bash prompt:

```bash
# Update all packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
# Install git and essentials
sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core curl
# Prerequisites:
sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev

# GPG key
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

# Grab RVM via curl
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
# Load RVM on login with .bashrc
echo " " >> ~/.bashrc
echo "# This loads RVM into a shell session." >> ~/.bashrc
echo ". ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bashrc
# Re-source .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install Ruby via RVM
rvm install 2.3.1
# Tell RVM to use 2.3.1 by default. Use ruby -v to verify.
rvm use 2.3.1 --default
ruby -v

# After that is done you can install Bundler
gem install bundler

# And finally: Install Jekyll!
gem install jekyll
```

### On Each Run

Search for "bash" in the Windows start menu. You should get "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" as your top result. Run it.

```bash
# You'll probably be told "X packages can be updated." upon launch
# Update all packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
# (will prompt for the password you created during initial setup)

# Go to the directory you cloned your blog repo to
# Tab completion works, but case-sensitivity matters
cd /mnt/c/Github/brianbunke.github.io/

# Run jekyll, building and watching the current directory:
jekyll serve -w --force_polling
```

Then, as referenced in the Bash window, you can hit `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser to view the local version of your site.

If you want to make any tweaks while Jekyll is running, it's also watching. You'll see a "Regenerating:" line in the Bash window after each save, after which you can simply refresh your browser.

Note that you _should_ be able to just run `jekyll serve`, but there is (was?) [a bug]. No idea if this is available to the general public, but I'm still doing it the long way as of May 2017.

Local previews make the writing/editing process far more tolerable, and removed the only real pain point I was feeling after migrating to [GitHub Pages]. But of course, don't take my word for it, it's your turn to try it out!
